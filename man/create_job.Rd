\description{
This function shall be called after the user defined a process graph for the back-end to create a job on the
back-end. Therefore the user sends the process graph and the optional output specifications like
format and additional creation parameter by '...'. To add some meta data about the job, the user might use title or 
description. By providing a execution plan and a maximum usable budget the user can change the execution behavior of the
back-end provider.
