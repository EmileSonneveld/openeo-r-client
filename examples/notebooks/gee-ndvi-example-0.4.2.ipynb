                                                    Starting in 2009, the Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology\\nBranch (STB) at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process\\nof generating annual crop type digital maps. Focusing on the Prairie\\nProvinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was\\napplied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (Radarsat-2) based\\nsatellite images. Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has\\nbeen extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory.\\nTo date this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets\\nthe overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of\\n30m (56m in 2009 and 2010).\\n\n",

Radiometer (ASTER)\\nis a multispectral imager that was launched on board NASA's Terra spacecraft\\nin December, 1999. ASTER can collect data in 14 spectral bands from the\\nvisible to the thermal infrared. Each scene covers an area of 60 x 60 km.\\nThese scenes, produced by the USGS, contain calibrated at-sensor radiance,\\northo-rectified and terrain corrected.\\n\\nNot all 14 bands were collected in each scene. An asset property named\\nORIGINAL_BANDS_PRESENT contains the list of bands that are present in each\\nscene.\\n\\nTo convert from Digital Numbers (DN) to radiance at the sensor, the unit\\nconversion coefficients are available in the metadata.

derived from some 236 individual LiDAR\\nsurveys between 2001 and 2015 covering an area in excess of 245,000\\nsquare kilometres. These surveys cover Australia's populated\\ncoastal zone; floodplain surveys within the Murray Darling Basin,\\nand individual surveys of major and minor population centres.\\nAll available 1 metre resolution LiDAR-derived DEMs have been\\ncompiled and resampled using a neighbourhood-mean method to 5\\nmetre resolution datasets for each survey area, and then merged\\ninto a single dataset for each State. Each state's dataset is\\nprovided as a separate image within the image collection.\\n\\nThe acquisition of the individual LiDAR surveys and derivation\\nof the 5m product has been part of a long-term collaboration\\nbetween Geoscience Australia, the Cooperative Research Centre\\nfor Spatial Information (CRCSI), the Departments of Climate Change\\nand Environment, State and Territory jurisdictions, Local Government\\nand the Murray Darling Basin Authority under the auspices of\\nthe National Elevation Data Framework and Coastal and Urban DEM\\nProgram. The source datasets have been captured to standards\\nthat are generally consistent with the Australian ICSM LiDAR\\nAcquisition Specifications with require a fundamental vertical\\naccuracy of at least 0.30m (95% confidence) and horizontal accuracy\\nof at least 0.80m (95% confidence).\\n\n",

three components, and\\ngross primary product (GPP) at 500m and 8-day resolution during 2002-2017\\nand with spatial range from -60°S to 90°N. The major advantages of the\\nPML_V2 products are:\\n\\n  1. coupled estimates of transpiration and GPP via canopy\\n  conductance (Gan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019)\\n  2. partitioning ET into three components: transpiration from vegetation,\\n  direct evaporation from the soil and vaporization of intercepted\\n   rainfall from vegetation (Zhang et al., 2016).\\n\\nThe PML_V2 products perform well against observations\\nat 95 flux sites across globe, and are similar to or noticeably better than\\nmajor state-of-the-art ET and GPP products widely used by water and ecology\\nscience communities (Zhang et al., 2019).\\n\n",

Population is distributed\\nto cells using proportional allocation of population from census and\\nadministrative units. Population input data are collected at the most\\ndetailed spatial resolution available from the results of the 2010 round of\\ncensuses, which occurred between 2005 and 2014. The input data are\\nextrapolated to produce population estimates for each modeled year.\\n\\n\\nThese population count grids contain estimates of the number of persons per\\n30 arc-second grid cell consistent with national censuses and population\\nregisters. There is one image for each modeled year.\\n\n",

               The Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11 models the distribution\\nof global human population for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020\\non 30 arc-second (approximately 1km) grid cells. Population is distributed\\nto cells using proportional allocation of population from census and\\nadministrative units. Population input data are collected at the most\\ndetailed spatial resolution available from the results of the 2010 round of\\ncensuses, which occurred between 2005 and 2014. The input data are\\nextrapolated to produce population estimates for each modeled year.\\n\\n\\nThese population density grids contain estimates of the number of persons\\nper 30 arc-second grid cell, consistent with national censuses and\\npopulation registers with respect to relative spatial distribution but\\nadjusted to match the 2015 Revision of UN World Population Prospects\\ncountry totals. There is one image for each modeled year.\\n\n",

to standardize data collection on land\\nin Europe to support environmental policy development. The project is\\ncoordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU\\nCopernicus programme and implemented by national teams. The number of\\nparticipating countries has increased over time currently including 33 (EEA)\\nmember countries and six cooperating countries (EEA39) with a total area of\\nover 5.8 Mkm2.\\n\\nThe reference year of the first CLC inventory was 1990 and the first update\\ncreated in 2000. Later, the update cycle has become 6 years. Satellite\\nimagery provides the geometrical and thematic basis for mapping with in-situ\\ndata as essential ancillary information. The basic technical parameters of\\nCLC (i.e. 44 classes in nomenclature, 25 hectares minimum mapping unit\\n(MMU), and 100 meters minimum mapping width) have not changed since the\\nbeginning, therefore the results of the different inventories are\\ncomparable.\\n\n",

This collection\\nincludes the S1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) scenes, processed\\nusing the Sentinel-1 Toolbox to generate a calibrated, ortho-corrected\\nproduct. The collection is updated weekly.\\n\\nThis collection\\ncontains all of the GRD scenes.  Each scene has one of 3 resolutions\\n(10, 25 or 40 meters), 4 band combinations (corresponding to\\nscene polarization) and 3 instrument modes.  Use of the collection\\nin a mosaic context will likely require filtering down to a homogenous\\nset of bands and parameters.  See [this article](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1)\\nfor details of collection use and preprocessing. Each scene contains\\neither 1 or 2 out of 4 possible polarization bands, depending\\non the instrument's polarization settings.  The possible combinations\\nare single band VV or HH, and dual band VV+VH and HH+HV:\\n\\n  1. VV: single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive\\n  2. HH: single co-polarization, horizontal transmit/horizontal receive\\n  3. VV + VH: dual-band cross-polarization, vertical transmit/horizontal\\n  receive\\n  4. HH + HV: dual-band cross-polarization, horizontal transmit/vertical\\n  receive\\n\\nEach scene also includes an additional 'angle' band that contains\\nthe approximate viewing incidence angle in degrees at every point.\\nThis band is generated by interpolating the 'incidenceAngle' property\\nof the 'geolocationGridPoint' gridded field provided with each asset.\\n\\nEach scene was pre-processed with [Sentinel-1 Toolbox](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/toolboxes/sentinel-1)\\nusing the following steps:\\n\\n  1. Thermal noise removal\\n  2. Radiometric calibration\\n  3. Terrain correction using SRTM 30 or ASTER DEM for areas greater than\\n     60 degrees latitude, where SRTM is not available.\\nThe final terrain-corrected values are converted to decibels via log scaling\\n(10*log10(x).\\n\\nFor more information about these pre-processing steps, please refer to the\\n[Sentinel-1 Pre-processing article](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1).\\n\\nThis collection is computed on-the-fly.

Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral\\nimaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies,\\nincluding the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover,\\nas well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.\\n\\nThe Sentinel-2 data contain 13 UINT16 spectral bands representing\\nTOA reflectance scaled by 10000. See the [Sentinel-2 User Handbook](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685211/Sentinel-2_User_Handbook)\\nfor details. In addition, three QA bands are present where one\\n(QA60) is a bitmask band with cloud mask information. For more\\ndetails, [see the full explanation of how cloud masks are computed.](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-1c/cloud-masks)\\n\\nEach Sentinel-2 product (zip archive) may contain multiple\\ngranules. Each granule becomes a separate Earth Engine asset.\\nEE asset ids for Sentinel-2 assets have the following format:\\nCOPERNICUS/S2/20151128T002653_20151128T102149_T56MNN. Here the\\nfirst numeric part represents the sensing date and time, the\\nsecond numeric part represents the product generation date and\\ntime, and the final 6-character string is a unique granule identifier\\nindicating its UTM grid reference (see [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System)).\\n\\nThe Level-2 data produced by ESA can be found in the collection\\nCOPERNICUS/S2_SR.\\n\\nFor more details on Sentinel-2 radiometric resolution, [see this page](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/resolutions/radiometric).\\n\n",

             Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral\\nimaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies,\\nincluding the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover,\\nas well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.\\n\\nThe Sentinel-2 L2 data are downloaded from COPERNICUS. They were\\ncomputed by running sen2cor. The assets contain\\n12 UINT16 spectral bands representing SR scaled by 10000 (unlike in L1 data,\\nthere is no B10). There are also several more L2-specific bands (see band\\nlist for details). See the\\n[Sentinel-2 User Handbook](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685211/Sentinel-2_User_Handbook)\\nfor details. In addition, three QA bands are present where one\\n(QA60) is a bitmask band with cloud mask information. For more\\ndetails, [see the full explanation of how cloud masks are computed.](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-1c/cloud-masks)\\n\\nEE asset ids for Sentinel-2 L2 assets have the following format:\\nCOPERNICUS/S2_SR/20151128T002653_20151128T102149_T56MNN. Here the\\nfirst numeric part represents the sensing date and time, the\\nsecond numeric part represents the product generation date and\\ntime, and the final 6-character string is a unique granule identifier\\nindicating its UTM grid reference (see [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System)).\\n\\nFor more details on Sentinel-2 radiometric resolution, [see this page](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/resolutions/radiometric).\\n\n",

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n### NRTI/L3_AER_AI\\n\\nThis dataset provides near real-time high-resolution imagery of the UV Aerosol Index\\n(UVAI), also called the Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI).\\n\\nThe AAI is based on wavelength-dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in\\nthe UV spectral range for a pair of wavelengths.  The difference between\\nobserved and modelled reflectance results in the AAI.  When the AAI is\\npositive, it indicates the presence of UV-absorbing aerosols like dust and\\nsmoke. It is useful for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from\\ndust outbreaks, volcanic ash, and biomass burning.\\n\\nThe wavelengths used have very low ozone absorption, so unlike aerosol optical\\nthickness measurements, AAI can be calculated in the presence of clouds.\\nDaily global coverage is therefore possible.\\n\\nFor this L3 AER_AI product, the absorbing_aerosol_index is calculated with a\\npair of measurements at the 354 nm and 388 nm wavelengths.\\n\\n### NRTI L3 Product\\n\\nTo make our NRTI L3 products, we use [harpconvert](http://www.stcorp.nl/beat/documentation/harp/harpconvert.html)\\nto grid the data.\\n\\nExample harpconvert invocation for one tile:\\n```\\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\\n-a 'absorbing_aerosol_index_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time});\\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\\nkeep(absorbing_aerosol_index,sensor_altitude,sensor_azimuth_angle,\\n     sensor_zenith_angle,solar_azimuth_angle,solar_zenith_angle)'\\nS5P_NRTI_L2__AER_AI_20181113T080042_20181113T080542_05618_01_010200_20181113T083707.nc\\noutput.h5\\n```\\n\n",

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n### NRTI/L3_CO\\n\\nThis dataset provides near real-time high-resolution imagery of CO\\nconcentrations.\\n\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an important atmospheric trace gas for understanding\\ntropospheric chemistry. In certain urban areas, it is a major atmospheric\\npollutant. Main sources of CO are combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning,\\nand atmospheric oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons. Whereas fossil\\nfuel combustion is the main source of CO at northern mid-latitudes, the oxidation\\nof isoprene and biomass burning play an important role in the tropics. TROPOMI\\non the Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P) satellite observes the CO global abundance\\nexploiting clear-sky and cloudy-sky Earth radiance measurements in the 2.3 µm\\nspectral range of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the solar spectrum.\\nTROPOMI clear sky observations provide CO total columns with sensitivity to the\\ntropospheric boundary layer.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n### NRTI/L3_HCHO\\n\\nThis dataset provides near real-time high-resolution imagery of atmospheric\\nformaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations.\\n\\nFormaldehyde is an intermediate gas in almost all oxidation chains of non-methane\\nvolatile organic compounds (NMVOC), leading eventually to CO<sub>2</sub>. Non-Methane Volatile\\nOrganic Compounds (NMVOCs) are, together with NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and CH<sub>4</sub>, among the\\nmost important precursors of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>. The major HCHO source in the remote\\natmosphere is CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. Over the continents, the oxidation of higher NMVOCs\\nemitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important\\nand localized enhancements of the HCHO levels. The seasonal and inter-annual\\nvariations of the formaldehyde distribution are principally related to temperature\\nchanges and fire events, but also to changes in anthropogenic activities.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n### NRTI/L3_NO2\\n\\nThis dataset provides near real-time high-resolution imagery of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.\\n\\nNitrogen oxides (NO<sub>2</sub> and NO) are important trace gases in the Earth’s atmosphere,\\npresent in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. They enter the atmosphere\\nas a result of anthropogenic activities (notably fossil fuel combustion and\\nbiomass burning) and natural processes (wildfires, lightning, and microbiological processes in\\nsoils). Here, NO<sub>2</sub> is used to represent concentrations\\nof collective nitrogen oxides because during daytime, i.e. in the presence of\\nsunlight, a photochemical cycle involving ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) converts NO into NO<sub>2</sub>\\nand vice versa on a timescale of minutes.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n### NRTI/L3_O3\\n\\nThis dataset provides near real-time high-resolution imagery of ozone concentrations.\\n\\nIn the stratosphere, the ozone layer shields the biosphere from dangerous\\nsolar ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it acts as an efficient\\ncleansing agent, but at high concentration it also becomes harmful to the\\nhealth of humans, animals, and vegetation. Ozone is also an important\\ngreenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change. Since the discovery\\nof the Antarctic ozone hole in the 1980s and the subsequent Montreal Protocol\\nregulating the production of chlorine-containing ozone-depleting substances,\\nozone has been routinely monitored from the ground and from space. For\\nTROPOMI/S5P, there are two algorithms that deliver total ozone: GDP for\\nthe near real-time and GODFIT for the offline products.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n### NRTI/L3_SO2\\n\\nThis dataset provides near real-time high-resolution imagery of atmospheric\\nsulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations.\\n\\nSulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) enters the Earth’s atmosphere through both natural and\\nanthropogenic processes. It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global\\nscale and its impact ranges from short-term pollution to effects on climate.\\nOnly about 30% of the emitted SO<sub>2</sub> comes from natural sources; the majority\\nis of anthropogenic origin. SO<sub>2</sub> emissions adversely affect human health and\\nair quality. SO<sub>2</sub> has an effect on climate through radiative forcing, via\\nthe formation of sulphate aerosols. Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions can also pose a\\nthreat to aviation, along with volcanic ash.

The difference between\\nobserved and modelled reflectance results in the AAI.  When the AAI is\\npositive, it indicates the presence of UV-absorbing aerosols like dust and\\nsmoke. It is useful for tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from\\ndust outbreaks, volcanic ash, and biomass burning.\\n\\nThe wavelengths used have very low ozone absorption, so unlike aerosol optical\\nthickness measurements, AAI can be calculated in the presence of clouds.\\nDaily global coverage is therefore possible.\\n\\nFor this L3 AER_AI product, the absorbing_aerosol_index is calculated with a\\npair of measurements at the 354 nm and 388 nm wavelengths.  The\\n[COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_SO2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S5P_OFFL_L3_SO2)\\nproduct has the absorbing_aerosol_index calculated using the 340 nm and 380\\nnm wavelengths.\\n\\n### OFFL L3 Product\\n\\nTo make our OFFL L3 products, we find areas within the product's bounding\\nbox with data using a command like this:\\n\\n```\\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\\n-a 'absorbing_aerosol_index_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'\\nS5P_OFFL_L2__AER_AI_20181030T213916_20181030T232046_05427_01_010200_20181105T210529.nc\\ngrid_info.h5\\n```\\n\\nWe then merge all the data into one large mosaic (taking only one value for\\npixels that may have different values for different times).

TROPOMI aims at providing CH<sub>4</sub>\\ncolumn concentrations with high sensitivity to the Earth’s surface, good\\nspatiotemporal coverage, and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse\\nmodeling of sources and sinks. TROPOMI uses absorption information from the\\nOxygen-A Band (760nm) and the SWIR spectral range to monitor CH<sub>4</sub> abundances\\nin the Earth's atmosphere. [[More information](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/methane)]\\n\\nCurrently, the following data quality issues are known, are not covered by\\nthe quality flags, and should be kept in mind when looking at the methane\\nproduct and also at preliminary validation results. For more details, see\\nthe [MPC VDAF website](http://mpc-vdaf.tropomi.eu).\\n\\nFiltering on qa_value &lt; 0.5 does not remove all pixels considered bad.\\nSome pixels with too low methane concentrations are still present:\\n\\n - Single TROPOMI overpasses show stripes of erroneous CH<sub>4</sub> values in the\\n   flight direction.\\n\\n - Not all pixels above inland water are filtered.\\n\\n - Uncertainties for the XCH<sub>4</sub> is only based on the single sounding\\n   precision due to measurement noise. For applications requiring an\\n   overall uncertainty estimate, we propose to multiply the provided error\\n   by a factor 2, which reflects the scatter of single sounding errors in\\n   the TCCON validation.\\n\\n - The current data release only provides XCH<sub>4</sub> over land. Glint ocean\\n   observations will be added in the next data release.\\n\\n### OFFL L3 Product\\n\\nTo make our OFFL L3 products, we find which areas within the product's\\nbounding box contain data by using a command like this:\\n\\n```\\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\\n-a 'CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'\\nS5P_OFFL_L2__CH4____20190223T202409_20190223T220540_07072_01_010202_20190301T221106.nc\\ngrid_info.h5\\n```\\n\\nWe then merge all the data into one large mosaic (taking only one value for\\npixels that may have different values for different times).  From the\\nmosaic, we create a set of tiles containing orthorectified raster data.\\n\\nExample harpconvert invocation for one tile:\\n```\\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\\n-a 'CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air_validity>50;\\nderive(datetime_stop {time});\\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\\nkeep(CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air, aerosol_height,\\naerosol_optical_depth, sensor_azimuth_angle, sensor_zenith_angle,\\nsolar_azimuth_angle, solar_zenith_angle)'\\nS5P_OFFL_L2__CH4____20190223T202409_20190223T220540_07072_01_010202_20190301T221106.nc\\noutput.h5\\n```\\n\n",

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n### OFFL/L3_CLOUD\\n\\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of cloud parameters.\\n\\nThe TROPOMI/S5P cloud properties retrieval is based on the OCRA and ROCINN\\nalgorithms currently being used in the operational GOME and GOME-2 products.\\nOCRA retrieves the cloud fraction using measurements in the UV/VIS spectral\\nregions and ROCINN retrieves the cloud height (pressure) and optical thickness\\n(albedo) using measurements in and around the oxygen A-band at 760 nm.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n###OFFL/L3_CO\\n\\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of CO concentrations.\\n\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an important atmospheric trace gas for understanding\\ntropospheric chemistry. In certain urban areas, it is a major atmospheric\\npollutant. Main sources of CO are combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning,\\nand atmospheric oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons. Whereas fossil\\nfuel combustion is the main source of CO at northern mid-latitudes, the oxidation\\nof isoprene and biomass burning play an important role in the tropics. TROPOMI\\non the Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P) satellite observes the CO global abundance\\nexploiting clear-sky and cloudy-sky Earth radiance measurements in the 2.3 µm\\nspectral range of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the solar spectrum.\\nTROPOMI clear sky observations provide CO total columns with sensitivity to the\\ntropospheric boundary layer. For cloudy atmospheres, the column sensitivity\\nchanges according to the light path.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n###OFFL/L3_HCHO\\n\\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of atmospheric\\nformaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations.\\n\\nFormaldehyde is an intermediate gas in almost all oxidation chains of non-methane\\nvolatile organic compounds (NMVOC), leading eventually to CO<sub>2</sub>. Non-Methane Volatile\\nOrganic Compounds (NMVOCs) are, together with NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and CH<sub>4</sub>, among the\\nmost important precursors of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>. The major HCHO source in the remote\\natmosphere is CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. Over the continents, the oxidation of higher NMVOCs\\nemitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important\\nand localized enhancements of the HCHO levels. The seasonal and inter-annual\\nvariations of the formaldehyde distribution are principally related to temperature\\nchanges and fire events, but also to changes in anthropogenic activities. HCHO concentrations\\nin the boundary layer can be directly related to the release of short-lived hydrocarbons, which\\nmostly cannot be observed directly from space.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n###OFFL/L3_NO2\\n\\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.\\n\\nNitrogen oxides (NO<sub>2</sub> and NO) are important trace gases in the Earth’s atmosphere,\\npresent in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. They enter the atmosphere\\nas a result of anthropogenic activities (notably fossil fuel combustion and\\nbiomass burning) and natural processes (wildfires, lightning, and microbiological processes in\\nsoils). Here, NO<sub>2</sub> is used to represent concentrations\\nof collective nitrogen oxides because during daytime, i.e. in the presence of\\nsunlight, a photochemical cycle involving ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) converts NO into NO<sub>2</sub>\\nand vice versa on a timescale of minutes. The TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> processing system is based\\non the algorithm developments for the DOMINO-2 product and for the EU QA4ECV NO<sub>2</sub>\\nreprocessed dataset for OMI, and has been adapted for TROPOMI.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n###OFFL/L3_O3\\n\\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of ozone concentrations.\\n\\nIn the stratosphere, the ozone layer shields the biosphere from dangerous\\nsolar ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it acts as an efficient\\ncleansing agent, but at high concentration it also becomes harmful to the\\nhealth of humans, animals, and vegetation. Ozone is also an important\\ngreenhouse-gas contributor to ongoing climate change. Since the discovery\\nof the Antarctic ozone hole in the 1980s and the subsequent Montreal Protocol\\nregulating the production of chlorine-containing ozone-depleting substances,\\nozone has been routinely monitored from the ground and from space. For\\nTROPOMI/S5P, there are two algorithms that deliver total ozone: GDP for\\nthe near real-time and GODFIT for the offline products. GDP is currently\\nbeing used for generating the operational total ozone products from GOME,\\nSCIAMACHY and GOME-2; while GODFIT is being used in the ESA CCI and the\\nCopernicus C3S projects.

The onboard sensor\\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\\n\\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline\\n(OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL\\nassets, but appear more quickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data\\nfrom a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains\\ndata only for a single hemisphere).\\n\\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\\nis performed).\\n\\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\\n\\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\\nremove any values with QA values of less than 50.\\n\\n\\n###OFFL/L3_SO2\\n\\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of atmospheric sulfur\\ndioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations.\\n\\nSulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) enters the Earth’s atmosphere through both natural and\\nanthropogenic processes. It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global\\nscale and its impact ranges from short-term pollution to effects on climate.\\nOnly about 30% of the emitted SO<sub>2</sub> comes from natural sources; the majority\\nis of anthropogenic origin. SO<sub>2</sub> emissions adversely affect human health and\\nair quality. SO<sub>2</sub> has an effect on climate through radiative forcing, via\\nthe formation of sulphate aerosols. Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions can also pose a\\nthreat to aviation, along with volcanic ash. S5P/TROPOMI samples the Earth’s\\nsurface with a revisit time of one day with unprecedented spatial resolution\\nof 3.5 x 7 km which allows the resolution of fine details including the\\ndetection of much smaller SO<sub>2</sub> plumes. [[More information](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/sulphur-dioxide)]\\n\\nFor this L3 SO<sub>2</sub> product, the absorbing_aerosol_index is calculated with a\\npair of measurements at the 340 nm and 380 wavelengths.  The\\n[COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_AER_AI](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S5P_OFFL_L3_AER_AI)\\nproduct has the absorbing_aerosol_index calculated using the 354 nm and 388\\nnm wavelengths.\\n\\n### OFFL L3 Product\\n\\nTo make our OFFL L3 products, we find areas within the product's bounding\\nbox with data using a command like this:\\n\\n```\\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\\n-a 'SO2_column_number_density_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'\\nS5P_OFFL_L2__SO2____20181228T231131_20181229T005301_06265_01_010105_20190104T083244.nc\\ngrid_info.h5\\n```\\n\\nWe then merge all the data into one large mosaic (taking only one value for\\npixels that may have different values for different times).

The SLGA can be used in studies of vadose zone\\nprocesses, including solute transport, groundwater and nutrient fluxes\\nbeyond the root zone, as well as a wide spectrum of ecological,\\nhydrological, and broader environmental applications.\\n\\nEach product contains six digital soil attribute maps and their upper and\\nlower confidence limits, representing the soil attribute at six depths:\\n0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm, and 100-200cm. These depths and\\nsoil attributes are consistent with the specifications of\\n[GlobalSoilMap](http://www.globalsoilmap.net/).\\n\\nThis collection has 12 images. Ten of them contain data for GSM primary\\nsoil attributes; the other two contain regolith depth and soil depth GSM\\nattributes.\\n\\n| Attribute                              | Description                                                                                                                   | Code | # of Bands |\\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------------|\\n| Bulk Density (whole earth)             | Bulk density of the whole soil (including coarse fragments) in mass per unit volume by a method equivalent to the core method | BDW  | 18         |\\n| Organic Carbon                         | Mass fraction of carbon by weight in the < 2mm soil material as determined by dry combustion at 900 Celsius                   | SOC  | 18         |\\n| Clay                                   | < 2μm mass fraction of the <2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                             | CLY  | 18         |\\n| Silt                                   | 2-20μm mass fraction of the < 2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                           | SLT  | 18         |\\n| Sand                                   | 20μm - 2mm mass fraction of the < 2mm soil material determined using the pipette method                                       | SND  | 18         |\\n| pH (CaCl2)                             | pH of 1:5 soil/0.01M calcium chloride extract                                                                                 | pHc  | 18         |\\n| Available Water Capacity               | Available water capacity computed for each of the specified depth increments                                                  | AWC  | 18         |\\n| Total Nitrogen                         | Mass fraction of total nitrogen in the soil by weight                                                                         | NTO  | 18         |\\n| Total Phosphorus                       | Mass fraction of total phosphorus in the soil by weight                                                                       | PTO  | 18         |\\n| Effective Cation Exchange Capacity     | Cations extracted using barium chloride (BaCl2) plus exchangeable H + Al                                                      | ECE  | 18         |\\n| Depth of Regolith                      | Depth to hard rock.

                                 The Earth Engine version of the Fire Information for Resource Management\\nSystem (FIRMS) dataset contains the LANCE fire detection product in\\nrasterized form. The near real-time (NRT) active fire locations are\\nprocessed by LANCE using the standard MODIS MOD14/MYD14 Fire and Thermal\\nAnomalies product. Each active fire location represents the centroid of a\\n1km pixel that is flagged by the algorithm as containing one or more fires\\nwithin the pixel. The data are rasterized as follows: for each FIRMS active\\nfire point, a 1km bounding box (BB) is defined; pixels in the MODIS\\nsinusoidal projection that intersect the FIRMS BB are identified; if\\nmultiple FIRMS BBs intersect the same pixel, the one with higher confidence\\nis retained; in case of a tie, the brighter one is retained.\\n\\nAdditional information can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/about-firms). \\n\n",

The Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover layers contain\\nestimates of the percentage of horizontal ground in each 30-m pixel covered\\nby woody vegetation greater than 5 meters in height. The data represent\\nthree nominal epochs, 2000, 2005 and 2010, compiled from the NASA/USGS\\nGlobal Land Survey (GLS) collection of Landsat data. The product is derived\\nfrom all seven bands of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and/or Landsat-7\\nEnhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), depending on the GLS image selection.\\n\\nTree cover, the proportional, vertically projected area of vegetation\\n(including leaves, stems, branches, etc.) of woody plants above a given\\nheight, affects terrestrial energy and water exchanges, photosynthesis and\\ntranspiration, net primary production, and carbon and nutrient fluxes. Tree\\ncover also affects habitat quality and movements of wildlife, residential\\nproperty value for humans, and other ecosystem services. The continuous\\nclassification scheme of the VCF product enables better depiction of land\\ncover gradients than traditional discrete classification schemes.\\nImportantly for detection and monitoring of forest changes (e.g.,\\ndeforestation and degradation), tree cover provides a measurable attribute\\nupon which to define forest cover and its changes. Changes in tree cover\\nover time can be used to monitor and retrieve site-specific histories of\\nforest change.\\n\\nThe dataset has been produced for three year epochs: 2000, 2005, 2010, with\\nan image in the collection for each available WRS2 path/row.\\n\n",

2000 epoch, 3,650,723 km2 of inland water were identified,\\naround three quarters of which were in North America and Asia. Boreal\\nforests and tundra hold the largest portion of inland water, about 40% of\\nthe global total. The data exhibits strong linear correlation with both the\\nMODIS dataset as well as 30-m resolution datasets over the United States\\nand Canada. Residual errors were due primarily to the seasonality of water\\ncover, snow and ice, and residual clouds.\\n\\nThe dataset contains one or more image for each available Landsat WRS2\\npath/row.\\n\n",

The dataset blends the high resolution\\nspatial data from PRISM with the high temporal resolution data\\nfrom the National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) to produce\\nspatially and temporally continuous fields that lend themselves\\nto additional land surface modeling.\\n\\nThis dataset contains provisional products that are replaced with\\nupdated versions when the complete source data become available.\\nProducts can be distinguished by the value of the 'status' property.\\nAt first, assets are ingested with status='early'. After several\\ndays, they are replaced by assets with status='provisional'.\\nAfter about 2 months, they are replaced by the final assets with\\nstatus='permanent'.\\n\n",

 The MACAv2-METDATA dataset is a collection of 20 global\\nclimate models covering the conterminous USA. The Multivariate Adaptive\\nConstructed Analogs (MACA) method is a statistical downscaling\\nmethod which utilizes a training dataset (i.e. a meteorological\\nobservation dataset) to remove historical biases and match spatial\\npatterns in climate model output.\\n\\nThe MACA method was used to downscale the model output from 20\\nglobal climate models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison\\nProject 5 (CMIP5) for the historical GCM forcings (1950-2005) and\\nthe future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP 4.5\\nand RCP 8.5 scenarios (2006-2100) from the native resolution of\\nthe GCMS to 4km.\\n\\n\\nThis version contains monthly summaries.\n",

integrated water supply and demand anomalies\\nacross the contiguous United States from 1979-present. The PDSI\\nis calculated using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration\\nderived from the gridded meteorological dataset of Abatzoglou (2013).\\n\\nPotential evapotranspiration is computed using the Penman-Montieth\\nequation for a reference grass surface. Available soil water holding\\ncapacity in the top 2.5m of the soil was derived from the STATSGO\\nsoils database and used in the computations. Whereas PDSI has typically\\nbeen computed on monthly timescales, we compute these data three-times\\na month to provide more timely updates.

It uses climatically aided interpolation,\\ncombining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the\\n[WorldClim dataset](http://worldclim.org/version2), with coarser spatial\\nresolution, but time-varying data from\\n[CRU Ts4.0](http://data.ceda.ac.uk//badc/cru/data/cru_ts/) and the\\n[Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55)](http://jra.kishou.go.jp/JRA-55/index_en.html).\\nConceptually, the procedure applies interpolated time-varying anomalies\\nfrom CRU Ts4.0/JRA55 to the high-spatial resolution climatology of\\nWorldClim to create a high-spatial resolution dataset that covers a broader\\ntemporal record.\\n\\nTemporal information is inherited from CRU Ts4.0 for most global land\\nsurfaces for temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure. However,\\nJRA55 data is used for regions where CRU data had zero climate stations\\ncontributing (including all of Antarctica, and parts of Africa,\\nSouth America, and scattered islands). For primary climate variables of\\ntemperature, vapor pressure, and precipitation, the University of Idaho\\nprovides additional data on the number of stations (between 0 and 8) that\\ncontributed to the CRU Ts4.0 data used by TerraClimate. JRA55 was used\\nexclusively for solar radiation and wind speeds.\\n\\nTerraClimate additionally produces monthly surface water balance datasets\\nusing a water balance model that incorporates reference evapotranspiration,\\nprecipitation, temperature, and interpolated plant extractable soil water\\ncapacity. A modified Thornthwaite-Mather climatic water-balance model and\\nextractable soil water storage capacity data was used at a 0.5° grid from\\nWang-Erlandsson et al. (2016).\\n\\nData Limitations:\\n\\n 1. Long-term trends in data are inherited from parent datasets.\\n    TerraClimate should not be used directly for independent assessments of\\n    trends.\\n\\n 2. TerraClimate will not capture temporal variability at finer scales than\\n    parent datasets and thus is not able to capture variability in\\n    orographic precipitation ratios and inversions.\\n\\n 3. The water balance model is very simple and does not account for\\n    heterogeneity in vegetation types or their physiological response to\\n    changing environmental conditions.\\n\\n 4. Limited validation in data-sparse regions (e.g., Antarctica).\\n\n",

image (backscattering coefficient) in the\\nglobal 25m resolution PALSAR-2/PALSAR SAR mosaic so that strong and\\nlow backscatter pixels are assigned as \"forest\" and \"non-forest\",\\nrespectively. Here, \"forest\" is defined as the natural forest\\nwith the area larger than 0.5 ha and forest cover over 10%. This\\ndefinition is the same as the Food and Agriculture Organization\\n(FAO) definition. Since the radar backscatter from the forest\\ndepends on the region (climate zone), the classification of\\nForest/Non-Forest is conducted by using a region-dependent\\nthreshold of backscatter. The classification accuracy is\\nchecked by using in-situ photos and high-resolution optical\\nsatellite images. Detailed information is available in the provider's\\n[Dataset Description](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/DatasetDescription_PALSAR2_Mosaic_FNF_revE.pdf).\\n\\nAttention:\\n\\n*   Backscatter values may vary significantly from path to path\\n    over high latitude forest areas. This is due to the change of\\n    backscattering intensity caused by freezing trees in winter.\\n    Please note that this may affect the classification of\\n    forest/non-forest.\\n\n",

            The global 25m PALSAR/PALSAR-2 mosaic is a seamless global\\nSAR image created by mosaicking strips of SAR imagery\\nfrom PALSAR/PALSAR-2. For each year and location,\\nthe strip data were selected through visual inspection of the\\nbrowse mosaics available over the period, with those showing minimum\\nresponse to surface moisture preferentially used. In cases\\nwhere the availability was limited (e.g., because of the requirement\\nfor observations during specific emergencies), data were necessarily\\nselected from the year before or after, including from 2006.\\n[Shimada et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.04.014)\\n\\nThe SAR imagery was ortho-rectificatied and slope corrected\\nusing the 90m SRTM Digital Elevation Model.\\nA destriping process (Shimada & Isoguchi, 2002, 2010) was applied\\nto equalize the intensity differences between neighboring strips,\\noccurring largely due to seasonal and daily differences\\nin surface moisture conditions.\\n\\nPolarization data are stored as 16-bit digital numbers (DN).\\nThe DN values can be converted to gamma naught values\\nin decibel unit (dB) using the following equation:\\n\\n  *    γ₀ = 10log₁₀(DN²) - 83.0 dB\\n\\nAttention:\\n\\n*   Backscatter values may vary significantly from path to path\\n    over high latitude forest areas. This is due to the change of\\n    backscattering intensity caused by freezing trees in winter.\\n\\nMore information is available in the provider's\\n[Dataset Description](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/DatasetDescription_PALSAR2_Mosaic_FNF_revH.pdf).\\n\n",

Precipitation (GSMaP) provides a global hourly rain rate with a 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution. GSMaP is a product of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, which provides global precipitation observations at three hour intervals.  Values are estimated using multi-band passive microwave and infrared radiometers from the GPM Core Observatory satellite and with the assistance of a constellation of other satellites.  GPM's precipitation rate retrieval algorithm is based on a radiative transfer model. The gauge-adjusted rate is calculated based on the optimization of the 24h accumulation of GSMaP hourly rain rate to daily precipitation by NOAA/CPC gauge measurement. This dataset is processed by GSMaP algorithm version 6 (product version 3). See [GSMaP Technical Documentation](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/doc/algorithm/GSMaPforGPM_20140902_E.pdf) for more details.\\n\\nThis dataset contains provisional products that are regularly replaced with updated versions when the data become available. The products are marked with a metadata property called 'status'. When a product is initially made available, the property value is 'provisional'. Once a provisional product has been updated with the final version, this value is updated to 'permanent'.\\nGSMaP for the reanalysis data (from 2000 to 2014) is also provided as JAXA/GPM_L3/GSMaP/v6/reanalysis.\n",

global hourly rain rate with a 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution. GSMaP is a product of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, which provides global precipitation observations at three hour intervals.  Values are estimated using multi-band passive microwave and infrared radiometers from the GPM Core Observatory satellite and with the assistance of a constellation of other satellites.  GPM's precipitation rate retrieval algorithm is based on a radiative transfer model. The gauge-adjusted rate is calculated based on the optimization of the 24h accumulation of GSMaP hourly rain rate to daily precipitation by NOAA/CPC gauge measurement. This dataset is processed by GSMaP algorithm version 6 (product version 3).

                             The GHSL relies on the design and implementation of new spatial data mining\\ntechnologies allowing to automatically process and extract analytics and\\nknowledge from large amount of heterogeneous data including: global,\\nfine-scale satellite image data streams, census data, and crowd sources or\\nvolunteered geographic information sources.\\n\\n\\nThis dataset depicts the distribution and density of population, expressed\\nas the number of people per cell, for reference epochs: 1975, 1990, 2000,\\n2015.\\n\\nResidential population estimates were provided by CIESIN GPW v4.

It is the representation of the degree of urbanization\\n([DEGURBA](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/degree-of-urbanisation/background))\\nconcept into the GHSL data scenario. Each grid in the GHS-SMOD has been\\ngenerated by integrating the GHSL built-up areas and GHSL population grids\\ndata for reference epochs: 1975, 1990, 2000, 2015.\\n\\nThe DEGURBA classification schema is a people-based definition of cities and\\nsettlements: it operates using as main input a 1 km² grid cell accounting\\nfor population at a given point in time. The DEGURBA discriminates the\\npopulation grid cells in three main classes: '[urban centers](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_centre)'\\n(cities), '[urban clusters](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_cluster)'\\n(towns and suburbs), and '[rural grid cells](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Rural_grid_cell)'.\\n(base). These class abstractions translate to 'high density clusters (HDC)',\\n'low density clusters (LDC)', and 'rural grid cells (RUR)', respectively,\\nin the GHS-SMOD implementation.\\n\\nThe 'HDC' differ from the DEGURBA '[urban centers](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_centre)'\\nin that they account for the over-fragmentation of cities in regions\\nwith large low-density residential development by integrating the\\nbuilt-up layer. In the GHS-SMOD representation, the 'HDC' are the spatial\\ngeneralization of contiguous population grid cells (4-connectivity,\\ngap-filling) with a density of at least 1500 inhabitants per km² or a\\ndensity of built-up surface > 50%, and a minimum total resident population\\nof 50000. The 'LDC' are continuous grid cells with a density of at least 300\\ninhabitants per km² and a minimum total population of 5000. The 'RUR' are\\ngrid cells outside 'HDC' and 'LDC' with population > 0 and < 300. Everything\\nelse is classified as inhabited areas where population = 0.\\n\\nThis dataset was produced in the World Mollweide projection (EPSG:54009).\\n\\nFor more information visit: [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod.php](http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod.php).\\n\n",

Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/global-surface-water/downloads_ancillary/DataUsersGuidev2.pdf).\\n\\nThese data were generated using 3,066,102 scenes from Landsat\\n5, 7, and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 10 October 2015.\\nEach pixel was individually classified into water / non-water\\nusing an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly\\nhistory for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999,\\n2000-2015) for change detection.\\n\\n\\nThis Monthly History collection holds the entire history of water detection\\non a month-by-month basis. The collection contains 380 images, one for each\\nmonth between March 1984 and October 2015.\\n\n",

Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/global-surface-water/downloads_ancillary/DataUsersGuidev2.pdf).\\n\\nThese data were generated using 3,066,102 scenes from Landsat\\n5, 7, and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 10 October 2015.\\nEach pixel was individually classified into water / non-water\\nusing an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly\\nhistory for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999,\\n2000-2015) for change detection.\\n\\n\\nThe Monthly Recurrence collection contains 12 images: monthly measures of\\nthe seasonality of water based on the occurrence values detected in that\\nmonth over all years.\\n\n",

Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/global-surface-water/downloads_ancillary/DataUsersGuidev2.pdf).\\n\\nThese data were generated using 3,865,618 scenes from Landsat\\n5, 7, and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 31 December 2018.\\nEach pixel was individually classified into water / non-water\\nusing an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly\\nhistory for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999,\\n2000-2018) for change detection.\\n\\n\\nThe Monthly Recurrence collection contains 12 images: monthly measures of\\nthe seasonality of water based on the

Most scenes were acquired by Landsat 1-3\\nin 1972-1983.  A few gaps in the Landsat 1-3 data\\nhave been filled with scenes acquired by Landsat 4-5 during the\\nyears 1982-1987.  These data contain 4 spectral bands:\\nGreen, Red, an NIR band, and a SWIR band.  In the typical\\nFalse-color presentation, the images appear red because\\nthe NIR band, displayed as red, highlights vegetation.\\n\n",

placed into Tier 1 and are considered suitable for time-series processing\\nanalysis. Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection.

Real-Time data DN values, representing scaled, calibrated at-sensor radiance.</p><p>Landsat scenes with the highest available data quality\\nare placed into Tier 1 and are considered suitable for time-series processing\\nanalysis. Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection. See more information\\n<a href=\"https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-collections\">in the USGS docs.</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>The T1_RT collection contains both Tier 1 and Real-Time (RT) assets.\\nNewly-acquired Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data are processed\\nupon downlink but use predicted ephemeris, initial bumper mode parameters,\\nor initial TIRS line of sight model parameters. The data is placed in the\\nReal-Time tier and made available for immediate download. Once the data\\nhave been reprocessed with definitive ephemeris, updated bumper mode\\nparameters and refined TIRS parameters, the products are transitioned to\\neither Tier 1 or Tier 2 and removed from the Real-Time tier. The transition\\ndelay from Real-Time to Tier 1 or Tier 2 is between 14 and 26 days.<p>For more information, see <a\\nhref=\"https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-8-data-users-handbook\">\\nLandsat 8 Handbook</a></p>\n",

placed into Tier 1 and are considered suitable for time-series processing\\nanalysis. Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection.

Real-Time data DN values, representing scaled, calibrated at-sensor radiance.</p><p>Landsat scenes with the highest available data quality\\nare placed into Tier 1 and are considered suitable for time-series processing\\nanalysis. Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection. See more information\\n<a href=\"https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-collections\">in the USGS docs.</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>The T1_RT collection contains both Tier 1 and Real-Time (RT) assets.\\nNewly-acquired Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data are processed\\nupon downlink but use predicted ephemeris, initial bumper mode parameters,\\nor initial TIRS line of sight model parameters. The data is placed in the\\nReal-Time tier and made available for immediate download. Once the data\\nhave been reprocessed with definitive ephemeris, updated bumper mode\\nparameters and refined TIRS parameters, the products are transitioned to\\neither Tier 1 or Tier 2 and removed from the Real-Time tier. The transition\\ndelay from Real-Time to Tier 1 or Tier 2 is between 14 and 26 days.<p>For more information, see <a\\nhref=\"https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-7-data-users-handbook\">\\nLandsat 7 Handbook</a></p>\n",

placed into Tier 1 and are considered suitable for time-series processing\\nanalysis. Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection.

placed into Tier 1 and are considered suitable for time-series processing\\nanalysis. Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection.

placed into Tier 1 and are considered suitable for time-series processing\\nanalysis. Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection.

The last composite of the year,\\nbeginning on day 361, will overlap the first composite of the\\nfollowing year by 3 days.  All the images from each 8-day period are\\nincluded in the composite, with the most recent pixel as the composite value.</p>\n",

Tier 1 includes Level-1 Precision Terrain (L1TP) processed data\\nthat have well-characterized radiometry and are inter-calibrated across the\\ndifferent Landsat sensors. The georegistration of Tier 1 scenes will be\\nconsistent and within prescribed tolerances [<=12 m root mean square error\\n(RMSE)]. All Tier 1 Landsat data can be considered consistent and\\ninter-calibrated (regardless of sensor) across the full collection.

The last composite of the year,\\nbeginning on day 361, will overlap the first composite of the\\nfollowing year by 3 days.

product) provides estimates of the timing of vegetation phenology at global scales. Additionally, it provides information related to the range and summation of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) computed from MODIS surface reflectance data at each pixel. It identifies the onset of greenness, greenup midpoint, maturity, peak greenness, senescence, greendown midpoint, dormancy, EVI2 minimum, EVI2 amplitude, integrated EVI2 over a vegetation cycle, as well as overall and phenology metric-specific quality information.\\nThe MCD12Q2 Version 6 data product is derived from time series of the 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) calculated from MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Vegetation phenology metrics are identified for up to two detected growing cycles per year. For pixels with more than two valid vegetation cycles, the data represent the two cycles with the largest NBAR-EVI2 amplitudes.\n",

is\\na 500 meter daily 16-day product. The Julian date represents\\nthe 9th day of the 16-day retrieval period, and consequently\\nthe observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo for\\nthat day. The MCD43A1 algorithm, as is with all combined products,\\nchooses the best representative pixel from a pool that includes\\nall the acquisitions from both the Terra and Aqua sensors from\\nthe retrieval period.\\n\\nThe MCD43A1 provides the three model\\nweighting parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric) for\\neach of the MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible (vis), near\\ninfrared (nir), and shortwave bands used to derive the Albedo\\nand BRDF products (MCD43A3 and MCD43A4). The Mandatory Quality\\nlayers for each of the 10 bands are supplied as well.\\n\n",

                              The Terra and Aqua combined MCD64A1 Version 6 Burned Area data product is\\na monthly, global gridded 500m product containing per-pixel burned-area\\nand quality information. The MCD64A1 burned-area mapping approach employs\\n500m MODIS Surface Reflectance imagery coupled with 1km MODIS active\\nfire observations. The algorithm uses a burn sensitive vegetation index (VI)\\nto create dynamic thresholds that are applied to the composite data.\\nThe VI is derived from MODIS shortwave infrared atmospherically corrected\\nsurface reflectance bands 5 and 7 with a measure of temporal texture.\\nThe algorithm identifies the date of burn for the 500m grid cells within\\neach individual MODIS tile. The date is encoded in a single data layer as\\nthe ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred, with\\nvalues assigned to unburned land pixels and additional special values\\nreserved for missing data and water grid cells.\\n\n",

                                              The MOD09A1 V6 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Terra MODIS bands 1-7 at 500m resolution and corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the seven reflectance bands is a quality layer and four observation bands. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite on the basis of high observation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading.\n",

The MODIS Surface Reflectance products provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance as it would be measured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or absorption. Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols. MOD09GQ version 6 provides bands 1 and 2 at a 250m resolution in a daily gridded L2G product in the Sinusoidal projection, including a QC and five observation layers. This product is meant to be used in conjunction with the MOD09GA where important quality and viewing geometry information is stored.\n",

for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the two reflectance bands, a quality layer is also included. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite on the basis of high observation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading.\n",

     The MOD11A1 V6 product provides daily land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity values in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid. The temperature value is derived from the MOD11_L2 swath product. Above 30 degrees latitude, some pixels may have multiple observations where the criteria for clear-sky are met. When this occurs, the pixel value is the average of all qualifying observations. Provided along with both the day-time and night-time surface temperature bands and their quality indicator layers are MODIS bands 31 and 32 and six observation layers.\n",

V6 product provides an average 8-day land surface temperature (LST)  in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid.  Each pixel value in MOD11A2 is a simple average of all the corresponding MOD11A1 LST pixels collected within that 8 day period.  The 8 day compositing period was chosen because twice that period is the exact ground track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. In this product, along with both the day- and night-time surface temperature bands and their quality indicator (QC) layers, are also MODIS bands 31 and 32 and eight observation layers.\n",

There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.\n",

Indices (VI): the Normalized\\nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).\\nThe NDVI is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National\\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution\\nRadiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The EVI has improved sensitivity over\\nhigh biomass regions.\\n\\nThe algorithm for this product chooses the best available\\npixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16-day period. The criteria\\nused are low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.\\n\n",

There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.\n",

and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). The product distinguishes between fire, no fire and no observation. This information is used for monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of fires in different ecosystems, detecting changes in fire distribution and identifying new fire frontiers, wild fires, and changes in the frequency of the fires  or their relative strength.

                                The MOD17A3H V6 product provides information about\\nannual Net Primary Productivity (NPP) at 500m pixel resolution.\\n Annual NPP is derived from the sum of the 45 8-day Net Photosynthesis\\n(PSN) products (MOD17A2H) from the given year.  The PSN value\\nis the difference of the GPP and the Maintenance Respiration\\n(MR) (GPP-MR).\\n\\nThis is a NASA version of this product. Another\\nversion is produced by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation\\nGroup ([NTSG](http://www.ntsg.umt.edu)), University of Montana\\n(UMT).  The NTSG version corrects the problem with cloud-contaminated\\nMODIS LAI-FPAR inputs to the MOD17 algorithm, but its resolution\\nis 1km. It is ingested into Earth Engine as MODIS/055/MOD17A3.\\nFor further details regarding the differences between the NTSG\\nand NASA versions of this product, please consult [this document\\n](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/about/docs/MOD17_NTSG_Note.pdf).\\n\n",

                                                           The MODOCGA V6 ocean reflectance product consists of 1 kilometer reflectance data from Terra MODIS bands 8-16. The product is referred to as ocean reflectance, because bands 8-16 are used primarily to produce ocean products, but this is not an ocean product as the tiles produced are land tiles.\n",

                                               The MYD09A1 V6 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Aqua MODIS bands 1-7 at 500m resolution and corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the seven reflectance bands is a quality layer and four observation bands. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite on the basis of high observation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading.\n",

The MODIS Surface Reflectance products provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance as it would be measured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or absorption. Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols. MYD09GQ version 6 provides bands 1 and 2 at a 250m resolution in a daily gridded L2G product in the Sinusoidal projection, including a QC and five observation layers. This product is meant to be used in conjunction with the MOD09GA where important quality and viewing geometry information is stored.\n",

for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the two reflectance bands, a quality layer is also included. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite on the basis of high observation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading.\n",

     The MYD11A1 V6 product provides daily land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity values in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid. The temperature value is derived from the MOD11_L2 swath product. Above 30 degrees latitude, some pixels may have multiple observations where the criteria for clear-sky are met. When this occurs, the pixel value is the average of all qualifying observations. Provided along with both the day-time and night-time surface temperature bands and their quality indicator layers are MODIS bands 31 and 32 and six observation layers.\n",

MYD11A2 V6 product provides an average 8-day land surface temperature (LST)  in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid.  Each pixel value in MYD11A2 is a simple average of all the corresponding MOD11A1 LST pixels collected within that 8 day period.  The 8 day compositing period was chosen because twice that period is the exact ground track repeat period of the Aqua and Aqua platforms. In this product, along with both the day- and night-time surface temperature bands and their quality indicator (QC) layers, are also MODIS bands 31 and 32 and eight observation layers.\n",

There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.\n",

Indices (VI): the Normalized\\nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).\\nThe NDVI is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National\\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution\\nRadiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The EVI has improved sensitivity over\\nhigh biomass regions.\\n\\nThe algorithm for this product chooses the best available\\npixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16-day period. The criteria\\nused are low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.\\n\n",

There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.\n",

and 11-micrometer radiances. The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). The product distinguishes between fire, no fire and no observation. This information is used for monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of fires in different ecosystems, detecting changes in fire distribution and identifying new fire frontiers, wild fires, and changes in the frequency of the fires  or their relative strength.

                                The MYD17A3H V6 product provides information about\\nannual Net Primary Productivity (NPP) at 500m pixel resolution.\\n Annual NPP is derived from the sum of the 45 8-day Net Photosynthesis\\n(PSN) products (MOD17A2H) from the given year.  The PSN value\\nis the difference of the GPP and the Maintenance Respiration\\n(MR) (GPP-MR).\\n\\nThis is a NASA version of this product. Another\\nversion is produced by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation\\nGroup ([NTSG](http://www.ntsg.umt.edu)), University of Montana\\n(UMT).  The NTSG version corrects the problem with cloud-contaminated\\nMODIS LAI-FPAR inputs to the MOD17 algorithm, but its resolution\\nis 1km. It is ingested into Earth Engine as MODIS/055/MOD17A3.\\nFor further details regarding the differences between the NTSG\\nand NASA versions of this product, please consult [this document\\n](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/about/docs/MOD17_NTSG_Note.pdf).\\n\n",

The product is referred to as ocean reflectance, because bands 8-16 are used primarily to produce ocean products, but this is not an ocean product as the tiles produced are land tiles.\n",

quality\\ninformation. Produced from both the Terra and Aqua MODIS-derived\\ndaily surface reflectance inputs, the algorithm analyzes the\\ndaily surface reflectance dynamics to locate rapid changes, uses\\nthat information to detect the approximate date of burning, and\\nmaps only the spatial extent of recent fires. It provides varied\\nquality assessment information and a single summary quality assessment\\nscore for each pixel.\\n\\nThe monthly MCD45A1 product is based\\non three months of atmospherically- and geometrically-corrected,\\ncloud-screened daily reflectance data.\\n\n",

about\\nannual Gross and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) at 1km pixel resolution.\\nNet Primary Productivity (NPP) defines the rate at which all plants\\nin an ecosystem produce net useful chemical energy.  In other words,\\nNPP is equal to the difference between the rate at which plants\\nin an ecosystem produce useful chemical energy (or GPP), and the\\nrate at which they expend some of that energy for respiration.\\n\\nThe version 055 of the NPP product is produced by the Numerical\\nTerradynamic Simulation Group ([NTSG](http://www.ntsg.umt.edu)),\\nUniversity of Montana (UMT).  It corrects the problem with cloud-contaminated\\nMODIS LAI-FPAR inputs to the MOD17 algorithm. The original, uncorrected\\ndatasets constitute the version 4 NPP products.

(informally called the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product) provides estimates of the timing of vegetation phenology at global scales. Additionally, it provides information related to the range and summation of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) computed from MODIS surface reflectance data at each pixel. It identifies the vegetation growth, maturity, senescence, and dormancy that mark seasonal cycles. MCD12Q2 is produced once a year with 24 months of input data (i.e. the 12 months of interest data bracketed by six month's data on either side).\n",

albedo) at local solar noon and bihemispherical reflectance (white-sky albedo). These albedo quantities are produced from the 16-day anisotropy models provided in MCD43B1 and represent averages of the underlying 500m values. If black-sky albedos at different solar zenith angles are required, then the MCD43B1 values should be used directly to generate them.\n",

consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation conditions.\\nBlue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers,\\n645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the\\nMODIS daily vegetation indices.</p>\\n\\n<p>The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements\\nNOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products\\nprovide continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also\\nincludes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy\\nbackground variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation\\nconditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere\\ncontamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS\\nNDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected\\nbi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds,\\nheavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.</p>\\n\\n<p>Global MOD13A1 data are provided every 16 days at 500-meter spatial\\nresolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection.\\nVegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions\\nand are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These\\ndata may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic\\nprocesses and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for\\ncharacterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, including\\nprimary production and land cover conversion.</p>\\n\\n<p>Version-5 MODIS Vegetation Indices products have attained Validation Stage\\n3.</p><p>Please visit <a href=\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/citing_our_data\">LP\\nDAAC 'Citing Our Data' page</a> for information on citing LP DAAC\\ndatasets.</p>\n",

                           The MOD16A2 V105 product provides information about\\n8-day global terrestrial evapotranspiration at 1km pixel resolution.\\nEvapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration\\nfrom the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. With long-term ET\\ndata, the effects of changes in climate, land use, and ecosystems\\ndisturbances can be quantified.\\n\\nThe MOD16A2 product is produced by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation\\nGroup [NTSG](http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/),\\nUniversity of Montana (UMT) in conjunction with NASA Earth Observing\\nSystem.

                            The FLDAS dataset (McNally et al. 2017), was designed to assist with food\\nsecurity assessments in data-sparse, developing country settings. It\\nincludes information on many climate-related variables including moisture\\ncontent, humidity, evapotranspiration, average soil temperature, total\\nprecipitation rate, etc.\\n\\nThere are multiple different FLDAS datasets; this one uses Noah version\\n3.6.1 surface model with CHIRPS-6 hourly rainfall that has been\\ndownscaled using the [NASA Land Surface Data Toolkit](https://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/ldt).\\nwhich is part of the [Land Information System\\nframework](LIS; http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Temporal desegregation is required so that daily\\nrainfall inputs can be used in both energy and water balance calculations\\n\\nFor forcing data, this simulation uses a combination of the new version of Modern-Era\\nRetrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data and Climate\\nHazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), a quasi-global rainfall\\ndataset designed for seasonal drought monitoring and trend analysis (Funk et al., 2015).\\n\n",

Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) ingests satellite and\\nground-based observational data products. Using advanced land surface\\nmodeling and data assimilation techniques, it generates optimal\\nfields of land surface states and fluxes.\\n\\n\\nGLDAS-2.0 is created to make climatologically consistent datasets using\\nthe Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset from Princeton University.\\nIt contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the\\nNoah Model 3.3. It currently covers the period from 1948 to 2010\\nand will be extended to recent years as the data become available.\\n\\nThe model simulation was initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil\\nmoisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that\\nday of the year. The simulation used the common GLDAS datasets for\\nland cover, land water mask, soil texture, and elevation. The MODIS-based\\nland surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 products. The data\\nused in this modelling were acquired as part of the mission of NASA's\\nEarth Science Division and archived and distributed by the\\nGoddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC).\\n\n",

Using advanced land surface\\nmodeling and data assimilation techniques, it generates optimal\\nfields of land surface states and fluxes.\\n\\n\\nGLDAS-2.1 is one of two components of the GLDAS Version 2 (GLDAS-2) dataset,\\nthe second being GLDAS-2.0. GLDAS-2.1 is analogous to GLDAS-1 product stream,\\nwith upgraded models forced by a combination of [GDAS, disaggregated GPCP,\\nand AGRMET radiation data sets](https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/GLDASforcing.php).\\n\\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the\\nconditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was\\nforced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\n(NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis\\nfields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation\\nClimatology Project (GPCP) precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003),\\nand the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological\\nmodeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields which became available\\nfor March 1, 2001 onwards.\\n\n",

GLDAS-2.0 is reprocessed with\\nthe updated Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset\\n(Sheffield et al., 2006) and upgraded Land Information System\\nVersion 7 (LIS-7). It covers the period 1948-2010, and will be extended\\nto more recent years as corresponding forcing data become available.\\n\\nThe model simulation was initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil\\nmoisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for\\nthat day of the year. The simulation used the common GLDAS datasets\\nfor land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask\\n(MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds, 1999), and\\nelevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in\\nthe current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used\\nin GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).\\n\n",

The Integrated Multi-satellitE\\nRetrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified algorithm that provides\\nrainfall estimates combining data from all passive-microwave\\ninstruments in the GPM Constellation.\\n\\nThis algorithm is intended to intercalibrate, merge, and interpolate\\nall satellite microwave precipitation estimates, together with\\nmicrowave-calibrated infrared (IR) satellite estimates, precipitation\\ngauge analyses, and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine\\ntime and space scales for the TRMM and GPM eras over the entire globe.\\nThe system is run several times for each observation time, first\\ngiving a quick estimate and successively providing better estimates\\nas more data arrive. The final step uses monthly gauge data to\\ncreate research-level products. See [IMERG Technical Documentation](https://pmm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/document_files/IMERG_doc.pdf)\\nfor more details on the algorithm.\\n\\nThis dataset contains provisional\\nproducts that are regularly replaced with updated versions when\\nthe data become available. The products are marked with a metadata\\nproperty called 'status'. When a product is initially made available,\\nthe property value is 'provisional'. Once a provisional product\\nhas been updated with the final version, this value is updated\\nto 'permanent'.\\n\n",

Mass Grids provides monthly\\ngravitational anomalies relative to a 2004-2010 time-mean baseline.\\nThe data contained in this dataset are units of \"Equivalent Water Thickness\"\\nwhich represent the deviations of mass in terms of vertical extent\\nof water in centimeters. See the provider's [Monthly Mass\\nGrids Overview](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/monthly-mass-grids/)\\nfor more details.\\n\\n\\nThe GRACE Tellus (GRCTellus) Monthly Mass Grids dataset is produced\\nby three centers: CSR (U. Texas / Center for Space Research),\\nGFZ (GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam), and JPL\\n(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Each center is a part\\nof the GRACE Ground System and generates Level-2 data\\n(spherical harmonic fields) used in this dataset.\\nThe output includes spherical harmonic coefficients\\nof the gravity field and of the dealiasing fields used to compute them.\\nSince each center independently produces the coefficients, the results\\nmay be slightly different. It is recommended for most users to\\nuse the mean of all three datasets. See the provider's [choosing a\\nsolution](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/choosing-a-solution/) page\\nfor more details.\\n\\n**Note**\\n\\n* Due to the sampling and post-processing of GRACE observations,\\n  surface mass variations at small spatial scales tend to be attenuated.\\n  Therefore, users should multiply the GRCTellus Land data by the\\n  scaling grid available at\\n  [NASA/GRACE/MASS_GRIDS/LAND_AUX_2014](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=NASA/GRACE/MASS_GRIDS/LAND_AUX_2014).\\n\\n* The GRCTellus Land grids processed from the Spherical Harmonic\\n  Level-2 data are not suited to accurately quantify ice mass\\n  changes over Greenland or Antarctica, or glaciers and ice caps.\\n  For those areas it is recommended to use JPL's mascon\\n  solution available as the following image collection:\\n  [NASA/GRACE/MASS_GRIDS/MASCON](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_GRACE_MASS_GRIDS_MASCON)\\n\n",

To minimize leakage from high land\\n  signals onto ocean signals, a destriping filter has been applied\\n  which may cause cause correlations over much larger distances.\\n\\n* The GRCTellus Ocean datasets are optimized to examine regional\\n  ocean bottom pressure, but NOT intended to be spatially\\n  averaged to determine global mean ocean mass.\\n\\n* A filtered version of the  GRCTellus Ocean dataset is also available\\n  which uses an alternative filtering method which may reduce leakage\\n  errors, and have results which agree better with altimetric sea surface\\n  height.

                  GRACE Tellus Monthly Mass Grids provides monthly\\ngravitational anomalies relative to a 2004-2010 time-mean baseline.\\nThe data contained in this dataset are units of \"Equivalent Water Thickness\"\\nwhich represent the deviations of mass in terms of vertical extent\\nof water in centimeters. See the provider's [Monthly Mass\\nGrids Overview](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/monthly-mass-grids/)\\nfor more details.\\n\\n\\nThis dataset is a filtered version of the GRACE Tellus (GRCTellus)\\nOcean dataset. The 'EOFR' bottom pressure (OBP) grids are obtained by\\nprojecting the data from the regular GRC Ocean grids product\\nonto the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of the\\nOcean Model for Circulation and Tides (OMCT). This effectively\\nfilters out signals in the GRACE data that are inconsistent\\nwith the physics and OBP variations in the OMCT ocean model.\\n\\nThe EOFR filtered reconstructed OBP fields agree\\nbetter with radar altimetric sea surface height,\\nreduce leakage around ice sheets and glaciers, and reduce\\nnoise in the mid latitudes where OBP variability is lower.\\n[(Chambers and Willis, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JTECHO738.1)\\n\\n**Note**\\n\\n* The GRCTellus Ocean datasets are optimized to examine regional\\n  ocean bottom pressure, but NOT intended to be spatially\\n  averaged to determine global mean ocean mass.\\n\n",

comprised of downscaled climate scenarios\\nfor the conterminous United States that are derived from the General\\nCirculation Model (GCM) runs conducted under the Coupled Model\\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5, see [Taylor et al. 2012](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00094.1))\\nand across the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as\\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, see [Meinshausen et al. 2011](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0156-z#page-1))\\ndeveloped for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel\\non Climate Change (IPCC AR5). The purpose of these datasets is to provide\\na set of high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that\\ncan be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are\\nsensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local\\ntopography on climate conditions.\\n\\nThe dataset contains monthly projections covering the periods from 1950\\nthrough 2005 (Retrospective Run) and from 2006 to 2099 (Prospective Run).\\nIt includes downscaled projections from 33 models. Not every\\nscenario contains projections from every model.\\n\\nNEX-DCP30 was prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames\\nResearch Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA\\nCenter for Climate Simulation (NCCS).\\n\n",

(CMIP5, see [Taylor et al. 2012](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00094.1))\\nand across the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as\\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, see [Meinshausen et al. 2011](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0156-z#page-1))\\ndeveloped for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel\\non Climate Change (IPCC AR5). The purpose of these datasets is to provide\\na set of high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that\\ncan be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are\\nsensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local\\ntopography on climate conditions.\\n\\nThe dataset contains monthly projections covering the periods from 1950\\nthrough 2005 (Retrospective Run) and from 2006 to 2099 (Prospective Run).\\nIt includes ensemble statistics calculated for each RCP from all model\\nruns available for the pr, tasmin, and tasmax bands.\\n\\nNEX-DCP30 was prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames\\nResearch Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA\\nCenter for Climate Simulation (NCCS).\\n\n",

Prediction (NCEP, formerly \"NMC\") and the\\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The goal of this joint\\neffort is to produce new atmospheric analyses using historical data as\\nwell as to produce analyses of the current atmospheric state (Climate Data\\nAssimilation System, CDAS). The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 project is using a\\nstate-of-the-art analysis/forecast system to perform data assimilation using\\npast data from 1948 to the present. The data have 6-hour temporal\\nresolution (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC) and 2.5 degree spatial\\nresolution.\\n\n",

Prediction (NCEP, formerly \"NMC\") and the\\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The goal of this joint\\neffort is to produce new atmospheric analyses using historical data as\\nwell as to produce analyses of the current atmospheric state (Climate Data\\nAssimilation System, CDAS). The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 project is using a\\nstate-of-the-art analysis/forecast system to perform data assimilation using\\npast data from 1948 to the present. The data have 6-hour temporal\\nresolution (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC) and 2.5 degree spatial\\nresolution.\\n\n",

Prediction (NCEP, formerly \"NMC\") and the\\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The goal of this joint\\neffort is to produce new atmospheric analyses using historical data as\\nwell as to produce analyses of the current atmospheric state (Climate Data\\nAssimilation System, CDAS). The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 project is using a\\nstate-of-the-art analysis/forecast system to perform data assimilation using\\npast data from 1948 to the present. The data have 6-hour temporal\\nresolution (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC) and 2.5 degree spatial\\nresolution.\\n\n",

is a\\ncollection of global daily 0.1 degree derived data from the PATMOS-x AVHRR\\nlevel-2b channel 1 (0.63 micron) orbital clear-sky radiance. The aerosol\\nproduct is generated from AVHRR imagery in cloud-free conditions during\\ndaytime over oceans.\\n\\nDue to the relatively large uncertainties associated with surface\\nreflectance over water glint area and land surface as well as limited\\nAVHRR retrieval channels, this dataset only includes retrieval over\\nnon-glint water surface (specifically at the anti-solar side of the orbit\\nwith viewing angle more than 40 degree away from the specular ray).

                                                This dataset provides a high quality Climate Data\\nRecord (CDR) of global infrared measurements from geostationary satellites.\\n\\nThe geostationary satellite data (GridSat-B1) provides data from 3\\nchannels: the CDR-quality infrared window (IRWIN) channel (near 11μm),\\nthe visible channel (near 0.6μm) and the infrared water vapor (IRWVP)\\nchannel (near 6.7μm). The GridSat-B1 data is projected onto a global\\n0.07 degree latitude equal-angle grid with date coverage spanning from\\n1980-present. This data is sourced from the 3-hourly International Satellite\\nCloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) B1 data. The satellites included in this\\ndataset with their longitudinal coverage over time can be seen [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/gridsat/images/isccp_coverage_VZA60_nolegend.png).\\nIn regions of overlap the CDR methodology merges satellites by selecting\\nthe nadir-most observations for each grid point.\\n\n",

Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature\\n(OISST) provides complete ocean temperature fields constructed by combining\\nbias-adjusted observations from different platforms (satellite, ships,\\nbuoys) on a regular global grid, with gaps filled in by interpolation.\\nSatellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)\\nprovides the main input which permits the high temporal-spatial coverage\\nbeginning in late 1981 to the present.\\n\\nThe OISST dataset has a single day's data processed twice. First a near\\nreal-time preliminary version is released with a lag of 1 day, and a final\\nversion with a lag of 14 days. The final version uses extra days for\\nsmoothing, and zonal bias correction in addition to replacing the\\npreliminary version.\\n\n",

as a global, high-resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-land\\nsurface-sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over\\nthe 32-year period of record from January 1979 to March 2011. It has been extended as an\\noperational real-time product.\\n\\nForecasts are initialized four times per day (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800\\nUTC). We ingest only a subset of bands from files matching\\ncdas1.t??z.pgrbh**03|00**.grib2 i.e. files of only 0-hour and 3-hour forecasts as the others are\\nomitted. The forecast length is indicated by the 'forecast_hour' metadata field.\\n\\nSome images contain only a subset of bands. Using this dataset with both \"00\" and \"03\" forecast\\ntypes will require you to cast the bands across the collection.\\n\n",

Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast\\nSystem (CFS) is a fully coupled model representing the interaction between\\nthe Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land, and sea ice. CFS was developed at the\\nEnvironmental Modeling Center (EMC) at NCEP. The operational CFS was\\nupgraded to version 2 (CFSv2) on March 30, 2011.\\n\\nForecasts are initialized four times per day (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800\\nUTC). This is the same model that was used to create the NCEP Climate\\nForecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and the purpose of the CFSv2 dataset is\\nto extend CFSR. We ingest only a subset of bands from files matching\\ncdas1.t??z.sfluxgrbf**06**.grib2.\\n\\nFor more information about CFS, please see the [CFS NOAA site](http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/).\\n\n",

                              The Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) Operational Line-Scan System\\n(OLS) has a unique capability to detect visible and near-infrared (VNIR)\\nemission sources at night.\\n\\n\\nThis collection contains global nighttime lights images with no sensor\\nsaturation. The sensor is typically operated at a high-gain setting to\\nenable the detection of moonlit clouds. However, with six bit quantization\\nand limited dynamic range, the recorded data are saturated in the bright\\ncores of urban centers. A limited set of observations at low lunar\\nillumination were obtained where the gain of the detector was set\\nsignificantly lower than its typical operational setting (sometimes by a\\nfactor of 100). Sparse data acquired at low-gain settings were combined\\nwith the operational data acquired at high-gain settings to produce the set\\nof global nighttime lights images with no sensor saturation. Data from\\ndifferent satellites were merged and blended into the final product in order\\nto gain maximum coverage.

surface\\nreflectance (VNP09GA) product provides an estimate of land\\nsurface reflectance from the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership\\n(S-NPP) VIIRS sensor. Data are provided for three imagery bands\\n(I1, I2, I3) at nominal 500 meter resolution (~463 meter) and nine\\nmoderate-resolution bands (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M7, M8, M10, M11) at nominal\\n1 kilometer (~926 meter) resolution. The 500 meter and 1 kilometer datasets\\nare derived through resampling the native 375 meter and 750 meter VIIRS\\nresolutions, respectively, in the L2 input product. These bands are\\ncorrected for atmospheric conditions to provide an estimate\\nof the surface spectral reflectance as it would be measured at ground level.\\n\\nThe data is temporally aggregated over each of the 16 possible passes per\\nday. When multiple observations are present for each day, only the first\\nof the highest-quality observations is included.\\n\\nFor additional information, visit the VIIRS [Land Product Quality\\nAssessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/NPP_QA/) and see\\nthe [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/vnp09_user_guide_v1.6.pdf).\\n\n",

(S-NPP) NASA Visible\\nInfrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Vegetation Indices (VNP13A1)\\ndata product provides vegetation indices by a process of\\nselecting the best available pixel over a 16-day acquisition period\\nat 500 meter resolution. The VNP13 data products are designed\\nafter the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\\nTerra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the\\ncontinuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\\n\\nThe VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: (1)\\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (2) the Enhanced\\nVegetation Index (EVI), and (3) Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2).\\n(1) NDVI is one of the longest continual remotely sensed time series\\nobservations, using both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands.\\n(2) EVI is a slightly different vegetation index that is more sensitive\\nto canopy cover, while NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll. (3) EVI2\\nis a reformation of the standard 3-band EVI, using the red band and\\nNIR band. This reformation addresses arising issues when comparing\\nVIIRS EVI to other EVI models that do not include a blue band. EVI2\\nwill eventually become the standard EVI.\\n\\nAlong with the three Vegetation Indices layers, this product also\\nincludes layers for near-infrared (NIR) reflectance; three shortwave\\ninfrared (SWIR) reflectance—red, blue, and green reflectance; composite\\nday of year; pixel reliability; view and sun angles, and a quality layer.\\n\\nFor additional information, visit the VIIRS [Land Product Quality\\nAssessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/NPP_QA/) and see\\nthe [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/vnp13_user_guide_atbd_v2.1.2.pdf).\\n\n",

Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB).\\n\\nAs these data are composited monthly, there are many areas of the globe\\nwhere it is impossible to get good quality data coverage for that month.\\nThis can be due to cloud cover, especially in the tropical regions, or due\\nto solar illumination, as happens toward the poles in their respective\\nsummer months. Therefore it is recommended that users of these data utilize\\nthe 'cf_cvg' band and not assume a value of zero in the average radiance\\nimage means that no lights were observed.\\n\\nCloud cover is determined using the VIIRS Cloud\\nMask product (VCM). In addition, data near the edges of the swath are not\\nincluded in the composites (aggregation zones 29-32).

radiance composite images using nighttime data from the\\nVisible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB).\\n\\nAs these data are composited monthly, there are many areas of the globe\\nwhere it is impossible to get good quality data coverage for that month.\\nThis can be due to cloud cover, especially in the tropical regions, or due\\nto solar illumination, as happens toward the poles in their respective\\nsummer months. Therefore it is recommended that users of these data utilize\\nthe 'cf_cvg' band and not assume a value of zero in the average radiance\\nimage means that no lights were observed.\\n\\nCloud cover is determined using the VIIRS Cloud\\nMask product (VCM). In addition, data near the edges of the swath are not\\nincluded in the composites (aggregation zones 29-32). Version 1 has NOT\\nbeen filtered to screen out lights from aurora, fires, boats, and other\\ntemporal lights. This separation is under development and will be included\\nin a later version of this time series. Also in development is a method to\\nseparate lights from background (non-light) values.\\n\\n\\nThis product is an alternative configuration of the VIIRS DNB using a\\nprocedure to correct for stray light. The correction procedure extends\\nvisible areas closer to the poles and improves dynamic range. It should be\\nnoted some artifacts are introduced due to the procedure used in twilight\\nregions; see [reference paper](http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2023107)\\nfor more details. This product excludes data\\nimpacted by cloud cover.\\n\n",

The Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) is part of Natural Resources\\nCanada's (NRCan) altimetry system and stems from the existing Canadian\\nDigital Elevation Data (CDED). In these data, elevations can be either\\nground or reflective surface elevations.\\n\\nThe CDEM is comprised of multiple DEMs with varying resolutions. These\\nvary according to latitude and have a base resolution of 0.75 arc-seconds.\\nFor more information see the [Product Specifications](http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/elevation/cdem_mnec/doc/CDEM_product_specs.pdf)\\n\n",

                                          The PRISM daily and monthly datasets are gridded climate datasets for the conterminous United States, produced by the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University. \\n\\nGrids are developed using PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model). PRISM interpolation routines simulate how weather and climate vary with elevation, and account for coastal effects, temperature inversions, and terrain barriers that can cause rain shadows. Station data are assimilated from many networks across the country. For more information, see the [Descriptions of PRISM Spatial Climate Datasets](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/documents/PRISM_datasets.pdf).\\n\\n**Note**\\n\\n* **Warning**: This dataset should not be\\n  used to calculate century-long climate trends due to non-climatic\\n  variations from to station equipment and location changes, openings\\n  and closings, varying observation times, and the use of relatively\\n  short-term networks. Please see the [dataset documentation\\n  ](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/documents/PRISM_datasets.pdf)\\n  for more details.\\n* It takes time for observation networks to conduct quality control and\\n  release station data. Therefore,\\n  PRISM datasets are re-modeled several times until six months\\n  have elapsed, when they are considered permanent. A [release\\n  schedule is available](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/calendar/).\\n* For use of the 30 arc-second (~800 m) version of this dataset\\n  please contact the provider at prism-questions@nacse.org\\n\n",

Making Earth System Data\\nRecords for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program,\\nconsists of mean monthly velocity maps for selected glacier outlet areas.\\nThe maps are generated by tracking visible features between optical\\nimage pairs acquired by the Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM),\\nthe Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), the Landsat 8\\nOperational Land Imager (OLI), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal\\nEmission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER).\\n\\n**Note**\\n\\nMonthly means are calculated from images, which may have acquisition\\ndates from the preceding or succeeding month. For the naming convention,\\nthe month is determined from where the midpoint Julian dates fall.\\nFor example, September monthly means may have been generated from\\nimages that were acquired in August or in October but the midpoint\\nJulian date between the images falls within September. The exact\\ndates used are included as per-image metadata fields.\\n\n",

merges microwave data from multiple satellites,\\nincluding SSMI, SSMIS, MHS, AMSU-B and AMSR-E, each inter-calibrated to the\\nTRMM Combined Instrument.\\n\\nAlgorithm 3B43 is executed once per calendar month to produce the single,\\nbest-estimate precipitation rate and RMS precipitation-error estimate field\\n(3B43) by combining the 3-hourly merged high-quality/IR estimates (3B42)\\nwith the monthly accumulated Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)\\nrain gauge analysis.\\n\\nAll of the global precipitation datasets have some calibrating data source,\\nwhich is necessary to control bias differences between contributing\\nsatellites.  The multi-satellite data are averaged to the monthly scale and\\ncombined with the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre's (GPCC) monthly\\nsurface precipitation gauge analysis. In each case the multi-satellite data\\nare adjusted to the large-area mean of the gauge analysis, where available\\n(mostly over land), and then combined with the gauge analysis using a\\nsimple inverse estimated-random-error variance weighting.  Regions with poor\\ngauge coverage, like central Africa and the oceans, have a higher weighting\\non the satellite input.\\n\\nSee the [algorithm description](https://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/3b43.html)\\nand the [file specification](https://pps.gsfc.nasa.gov/Documents/filespec.TRMM.V7.pdf)\\nfor details.\\n\n",

                               Primary humid tropical forests provide numerous global ecosystem services,\\nbut are under continuing threat of clearing from economic drivers. To facilitate\\nnational land use planning and balancing the goals of economic development and\\nmaintenance of ecosystem services, a primary humid tropical forest map was\\ncreated by the UMD GLAD team. The primary forest extent was mapped\\nfor the year 2001 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters using globally acquired,\\nfree-of-charge, and consistently processed Landsat imagery.\\n\n",

canopy, buildings, and other\\nman-made surface features. The 2m asset is a collection of strips rather\\nthan a single mosaic due to projection differences between strips.\\n\\n\\nStrip DEM files correspond to the overlapping area of the input stereopair\\nimage swaths as they are collected by DigitalGlobe’s constellation of\\npolar-orbiting satellites. Strip DEM dimensions will vary according to the\\nsatellite sensor that acquired the images and the off-nadir angle of\\ncollection. Most strips are between 16km and 18km in width, and 110km and\\n120km in length.\\n\n",

                                       ArcticDEM is a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and National\\nScience Foundation (NSF) public-private initiative to automatically produce\\na high-resolution, high-quality digital surface model (DSM) of the Arctic\\nusing optical stereo imagery, high-performance computing, and open source\\nphotogrammetry software. It includes vegetation, tree canopy, buildings, and\\nother man-made surface features. The 2m asset is a collection of strips rather\\nthan a single mosaic due to projection differences between strips.\\n\\n\\nStrip DEM files correspond to the overlapping area of the input stereopair\\nimage swaths as they are collected by DigitalGlobe’s constellation of\\npolar-orbiting satellites. Strip DEM dimensions will vary according to the\\nsatellite sensor that acquired the images and the off-nadir angle of\\ncollection. Most strips are between 16km and 18km in width, and 110km and\\n120km in length.\\n\n",

tidal flat\\necosystems produced via a supervised classification of 707,528 Landsat\\nArchive images. Each pixel was classified into tidal flat, permanent water\\nor other with reference to a globally distributed set of training data.\\n\\nThe classification was implemented along the entire global coastline\\nbetween 60° North and 60° South from 1 January 1984 to 31 December 2016.\\nThe image collection consists consists of a time-series of 11 global maps\\nof tidal flats at 30m pixel resolution for set time-periods (1984−1986;\\n1987−1989; 1990−1992; 1993−1995; 1996−1998; 1999−2001; 2002−2004;\\n2005−2007; 2008−2010; 2011−2013; 2014−2016)\\n\\n\\nThis product depicts tidal flat ecosystems around the global coastline.\\n\\nPixels classified as tidal flat in the analysis represent several types of\\ntidal flat ecosystems, including unconsolidated fine-grain sediments (tidal\\nmudflats), unconsolidated coarse-grain sediments (tidal sand flats), and\\nconsolidated sediments, organic material or rocks (wide tidal\\nrock-platforms), while excluding spectral signatures indicating the\\npresence of vegetation dominated intertidal ecosystems such as mangroves\\nand vegetated marshes. The analysis aimed to identify pixels that are\\nsubject to regular tidal inundation, and therefore may also include other\\nintertidal systems where intertidal dynamics are observable.\\n\n",

agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.\\n\\nNAIP projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the\\nFSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on\\na 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began\\nin 2009.\\n\\nNAIP imagery is acquired at a one-meter ground sample distance (GSD) with a\\nhorizontal accuracy that matches within six meters of photo-identifiable\\nground control points, which are used during image inspection.\\n\\nOlder images were collected using 3 bands (Red, Green, and Blue: RGB), but\\nnewer imagery is usually collected with an additional near-infrared band\\n(RGBN). RGB asset ids begin with 'n_', NRG asset ids begin with 'c_', RGBN\\nasset ids begin with 'm_'.\\n\n",

                                 The Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA) is a seamless\\nand virtually cloudless mosaic created from processed\\nLandsat 7 ETM+ scenes.\\n\\n\\nProcessed Landsat Scenes (16 bit) are Level 1Gt NLAPS\\nscenes converted to 16 bit, processed with sun-angle\\ncorrection, and converted to reflectance values\\n([Bindschadler 2008](https://lima.usgs.gov/LIMA_paper.pdf)).\\n\\nEach Landsat scene is processed with elevation\\ndata and sun-angle correction to ensure surface features\\nwere accurately represented. The sun's angle in Antarctica\\ngives the appearance of a setting sun. Because of the low\\nsun angle, as Landsat passes over Antarctica, the outer\\nedges of the continent appear brighter than areas closer\\nto the South Pole, so scenes have bright and dark areas.\\nInconsistent sun angles and shadows where corrected for\\nthese scenes. Without this process, mosaicking would produce\\na patchwork of scenes since each scene would have a brighter\\nand a darker side.\\n\\nUsers can find individual image metadata available as a table at:\\n[USGS/LIMA/SR_METADATA](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=USGS/LIMA/SR_METADATA)\\n\n",

cover\\ndatabase spanning 8 epochs (1992, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2016).\\n1992 data are primarily based on unsupervised classification of Landsat data,\\nwhile the rest of the images rely on the imperviousness data layer for the\\nurban classes and on a decision-tree classification for the rest. The 1992\\nimage is not directly comparable to any later editions of NLCD.\\n\\nThis dataset has one image for the continental US for each of the\\neight epochs, plus separate images for Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico in 2001 and 2011.\\n(They could not be merged in due to having a different projection from the continental US\\nimages.)\\n\\nNote that the impervious layers and tree cover layers for Alaska 2011\\nonly have data for parts of Alaska.  For the impervious layer, only the\\nparts of Kenai Peninsula Borough and Anchorage Municipality are available.\\nTree cover is only available on a strip along the coast from the southern\\ntip of the Alaskan Panhandle up through the Kenai Peninsula, plus Kodiak\\nIsland.\\n\\nNLCD 2016 Shrub Component products characterize the percentage of each\\n30-meter pixel in the Western United States covered by shrub, herbaceous,\\nbare ground, litter, sagebrush, big sagebrush and annual herbaceous, along\\nwith estimating shrub height and sagebrush height. These products have\\nbeen produced by USGS in collaboration with the Bureau of Land Management.\\n\\nNLCD products are created by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics\\n(MRLC) Consortium, a partnership of federal agencies led by the\\nU.S. Geological Survey.\\n\n",

for estimating the dryness of\\nthe soil and duff layers. The index increases for each day without rain (the amount of increase\\ndepends on the daily high temperature) and decreases when it rains. This system is based\\nprimarily on recent rainfall patterns. It is a measure of meteorological drought; it reflects\\nwater gain or loss within the soil.\\n\\nThe scale ranges from 0 (no moisture deficit) to 800 (extreme drought). The range of the index\\nis determined by assuming that there is 20 cm of moisture in a saturated soil that is readily\\navailable to the vegetation (Keetch and Byram, 1968). KBDI is world widely used for drought\\nmonitoring for national weather forecast, wildfire prevention and usefully especially in regions\\nwith rain-fed crops.\\n\n",

combination of two MODIS\\nproducts: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and FIRMS\\n(Fires Information for Resource Management System). NDVI updates are\\nprocessed every 16 days, while fire updates are processed daily. Models\\nare developed individually for each ecogroup to relate the two inputs to\\nthe area of clearing, using the Hansen annual tree cover loss data to train\\nthe model. The minimum threshold to qualify as an alert is 25% of the pixel\\ncleared, though thresholds vary by ecogroup to minimize false positives.\\nHere is an [example script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/f29b1e4360f3fc36847bd789ceeb20f6)\\nfor a quick introduction to the FORMA datasets.\\n\\n\\nThe images in this ImageCollection contain the “reversed rectified\\nt-statistics” used in calculating NTT, the vegetation color index derived\\nfrom MODIS NDVI that FORMA uses to measure browning. Using a sum reducer on\\nover various date ranges in this ImageCollection produces an “NTT” image.\\n\\nThe images are broken by \"ecogroup\".

are\\na prerequisite for the accurate measurement of the impacts of population\\ngrowth, for monitoring changes, and for planning interventions. The WorldPop\\nproject aims to meet these needs through the provision of detailed and open\\naccess population distribution datasets built using transparent and\\npeer-reviewed approaches.\\n\\nFull details on the methods and datasets used in constructing the\\ndata, along with open access publications, are provided on the\\n[WorldPop website](http://www.worldpop.org.uk). In brief, recent census-based\\npopulation counts matched to their associated administrative units are\\ndisaggregated to ≈100x100m grid cells through machine learning approaches\\nthat exploit the relationships between population densities and a range of\\ngeospatial covariate layers. The datasets depict estimated number of people\\nresiding in each grid cell in 2010, 2015, and other years. The mapping approach\\nis Random Forest-based dasymetric redistribution.\\n\\nFurther WorldPop gridded datasets on population age structures,\\npoverty, urban growth, and population dynamics are freely available on\\nthe WorldPop website. WorldPop represents a collaboration between\\nresearchers at the University of Southampton, Universite Libre de\\nBruxelles, and University of Louisville.

High-resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are\\na prerequisite for the accurate measurement of the impacts of population\\ngrowth, for monitoring changes, and for planning interventions. The WorldPop\\nproject aims to meet these needs through the provision of detailed and open\\naccess population distribution datasets built using transparent and\\npeer-reviewed approaches.\\n\\nFull details on the methods and datasets used in constructing the\\ndata, along with open access publications, are provided on the\\n[WorldPop website](http://www.worldpop.org.uk). In brief, recent census-based\\npopulation counts matched to their associated administrative units are\\ndisaggregated to ≈100x100m grid cells through machine learning approaches\\nthat exploit the relationships between population densities and a range of\\ngeospatial covariate layers. The datasets depict estimated number of people\\nresiding in each grid cell in 2010, 2015, and other years.\\n\\nFurther WorldPop gridded datasets on population age structures,\\npoverty, urban growth, and population dynamics are freely available on\\nthe WorldPop website. WorldPop represents a collaboration between\\nresearchers at the University of Southampton, Universite Libre de\\nBruxelles, and University of Louisville. The project is principally\\nfunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\\n"
